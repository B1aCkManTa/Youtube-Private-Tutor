## Description
<YouTube Private Tutor is a Python-based project designed to provide personalized tutoring experiences leveraging YouTube videos. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to transcribe, analyze, and respond to user queries based on the content of YouTube videos.>

## Features:
- Transcription and Chunking: Extracts text transcripts from YouTube videos and splits them into manageable chunks for analysis.
- Semantic Encoding and Storage: Encodes text chunks into numerical vectors and stores them efficiently in a vector database using FAISS.
- Cosine Similarity Search: Utilizes cosine similarity to retrieve the most relevant text chunks from the database based on user queries.
- Language Model (LM) Integration: Integrates with state-of-the-art language models, such as GPT-3.5, to generate contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- Streamlit Frontend: Provides a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit for users to input questions and receive detailed responses based on the content of the YouTube videos.
